# Open-API-Project

Open API project for Intro to Programming course, Code the Dream.

This web app accesses data from two endpoints: images and breeds. I used two open-source APIs: TheDogAPI and TheCatAPI for my website. It contains a test called "Are you a cat or a dog person?". I fetched random images of a cat and a dog. Depending on the test results, there will be 10 photos of cats or dogs, and by hovering over these images, we can see the breed of each one.
